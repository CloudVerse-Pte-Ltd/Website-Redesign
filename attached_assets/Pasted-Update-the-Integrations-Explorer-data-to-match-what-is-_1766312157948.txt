Update the Integrations Explorer data to match what is ALREADY in production and what is coming soon.
Do NOT change the Integrations page layout, styling, components, or spacing.
Only edit the integrations data source (e.g., integrationsData.ts) and any copy inside the Drawer details.

============================================================
STATUS DEFINITIONS (STRICT)
- Available = live in production today
- Beta = functional but not fully GA / limited rollout
- Coming soon = not yet available

============================================================

============================================================
COMING SOON (STATUS = Coming soon)
- Snowflake
- “Top SaaS (Top 10)” as a placeholder category group (do NOT list 10 vendors yet)

============================================================
CATEGORIES (USE THESE)
Cloud, Data, AI, Kubernetes, Infrastructure, Identity, Ticketing, Collaboration, Observability, SaaS

Map items:
- AWS/Azure/GCP/OCI/AliCloud/Huawei/Tencent => Cloud
- Databricks/Snowflake => Data
- OpenAI => AI
- Kubernetes/OpenShift => Kubernetes
- vCenter => Infrastructure
- OAuth Microsoft / OAuth Google / Entra ID => Identity
- Jira/ServiceNow => Ticketing
- Slack/Teams => Collaboration
- Cloud Monitoring => Observability
- Top SaaS (Top 10) placeholder + future vendors => SaaS

============================================================
CARD “SHORT” COPY (ONE LINE EACH, CLEAN)
Update the short description per integration to be crisp and consistent. Examples:

AWS:
Billing and usage ingestion with allocation dimensions.
Azure:
Billing, subscriptions, and cost dimensions across tenants.
Google Cloud:
Billing and usage via BigQuery-backed exports and APIs.
OCI:
Billing and usage across tenancy compartments.
Alibaba Cloud:
Billing and usage ingestion for multi-cloud visibility.
Huawei Cloud:
Billing and usage ingestion for enterprise reporting.
Tencent Cloud:
Billing and usage ingestion across accounts and regions.

Databricks:
Workspace usage and compute costs for analytics spend.
OpenAI:
API usage, token consumption, and cost signals.

Kubernetes:
Cluster usage and workload attribution via agent.
OpenShift:
Cluster and namespace attribution for enterprise platforms.
vCenter:
Virtual infrastructure inventory and usage attribution.

OAuth Microsoft:
SSO via Microsoft OAuth for secure login.
OAuth Google:
SSO via Google OAuth for secure login.
Microsoft Entra ID:
Directory sync for identity-based allocation and governance.

Jira:
Tickets and ownership context for allocation and ops.
ServiceNow:
ITSM + ownership context for governance and accountability.
Slack:
Alerts and notifications delivery for anomalies and automation.
Microsoft Teams:
Notifications and approvals for automation workflows.

Cloud Monitoring:
Signals from CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, and Google monitoring.

Snowflake (Coming soon):
Warehouse consumption and credits for data spend.
Top SaaS (Top 10) (Coming soon):
Key SaaS spend and usage normalization.

============================================================
DRAWER DETAILS (STRUCTURED)
For each integration, set:
- whatWeIngest: 3–6 bullets
- outputs: 3–6 bullets
- setup.method: one of [Read-only API, Billing export, Agent, Webhook]
- setup.timeToValue: realistic and short (e.g. 15–30 minutes)
- setup.permissions: “Read-only, scoped…” or “Agent with minimal telemetry…”

IMPORTANT SPECIAL SETUP DETAILS (MUST MATCH)
- Azure must mention billing export support.
- GCP must mention BigQuery billing export support.
- Cloud Monitoring must mention CloudWatch/Azure Monitor/GCP Monitoring.
- Kubernetes/OpenShift use Agent.
- Slack/Teams use Webhook or OAuth + webhook depending on existing implementation (pick the correct one if known; otherwise use “Webhook”).
- Entra ID is “Read-only API”.

Do NOT add vendor lists in the hero.
Do NOT add logos.
Do NOT add new UI elements.

============================================================
SORTING & DEFAULTS
- Keep current sorting logic, but ensure “Available” items appear first within a category.
- Keep the same filters (Category + Status).
- Ensure Search matches these new names (e.g., “AliCloud” searchable as “Alibaba Cloud” too).

Implement aliases:
- AliCloud should be searchable by “AliCloud” and “Alibaba”
- GCP searchable by “Google Cloud”
- Entra searchable by “Azure AD” too
- Cloud Monitoring searchable by “CloudWatch”, “Azure Monitor”, “Google Monitoring”
- vCenter searchable by “VMware”

============================================================
DELIVERABLE
- Integrations grid accurately reflects production reality
- No UI/layout changes
- Drawer details are consistent, structured, and enterprise-grade
