Implement a slow crossfade inside the “OUTCOMES window” between 2 outcome sets (Visibility ↔ Automation), and add GPU/AI provider logos (OpenAI, Databricks) in the right column on the AIX page.

IMPORTANT:
- Premium/Apple feel only (no flashy animations).
- Use crossfade (opacity), not slide.
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion.
- Keep typography and spacing consistent with the existing AIX-style window.

========================================================
PART A — OUTCOMES CROSSFADE (HOME + PLATFORM where used)

1) Create two outcome sets:

SET A (Visibility):
- Unified Cost Visibility — Real-time view across clouds and services
- Clean Allocation — Normalized dimensions for showback and chargeback
- Real-time Anomalies — Detect and predict spikes before impact
- Compliance Ready — Audit trails, access controls, deployment options
- Multi-cloud Native — Built for heterogeneous enterprise environments

SET B (Automation):
- Automated Optimization — Apply savings actions with guardrails
- 40+ ML Models — Recommendations powered by predictive models
- Realized Savings — Track outcomes, not just estimates
- Policy-driven Control — Approvals, RBAC, and safe defaults
- AI-era Spend Ops — Optimize cloud, data, and AI workloads

2) In the OutcomesWindow component:
- Render BOTH sets stacked in the same area
- Crossfade between them using CSS animation (opacity only)
- Duration: 8s per set, with 1s fade transition
- Total loop: 16s (alternate)
- Keep layout height stable so the window does not jump

Implementation approach:
- Wrap each set in an absolutely-positioned panel:
  position:absolute; inset:0;
- Use keyframes to alternate opacity:
  panelA visible first half, panelB visible second half
- Use pointer-events:none for hidden panel
- Keep content readable (no blur)

3) Add prefers-reduced-motion:
- If reduced motion, disable animation and show Set A only.

========================================================
PART B — RIGHT COLUMN: PROVIDER LOGOS (AIX PAGE)

1) On the AIX page, in the right column “Supported platforms”/logo grid:
- Add OpenAI and Databricks logos
- Keep style consistent:
  - grayscale
  - opacity ~0.8
  - height h-6
  - no hover effects
  - responsive wrap

2) Keep the list minimal: don’t add more providers beyond OpenAI + Databricks right now.

========================================================
PART C — QA
Verify:
- Crossfade feels calm (not distracting)
- No layout jump when swapping sets
- Looks great on 375px / 768px / 1440px
- Reduced-motion shows static Set A
- AIX right-column shows OpenAI + Databricks correctly in both light/dark themes (if applicable)

DELIVERABLE:
Premium crossfading outcomes window + AIX right-column updated with OpenAI + Databricks.
