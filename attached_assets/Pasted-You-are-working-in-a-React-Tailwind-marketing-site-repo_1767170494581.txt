You are working in a React + Tailwind marketing site repo (CloudVerse-Website/client).

GOAL: Clean up and refactor the Home page end-to-end, fix spacing/responsiveness, restore the premium “AIX-style” hero card, restore the stronger “How CloudVerse works” cards, and move “Deployment options” from Security → Home. Also remove “Security” from the top nav.

HARD REQUIREMENTS
1) Home page must have a premium hero: 2-column layout on desktop, stacked on mobile.
   - Left: headline, subcopy, deployment/air-gapped line, CTAs.
   - Right: Apple-style “window” outcomes card (like AIX): larger size, comfortable padding, looser line-height, not cramped.
2) Under the hero, add a “Deployment options” section (moved from Security):
   Title: “Deployment options”
   Subtitle: “Choose the deployment model that fits your security requirements.”
   Cards: Cloud, Private, Air-gapped.
   - Cloud: hosted CloudVerse
   - Private: your VPC/VNet / private cluster
   - Air-gapped: offline / regulated environments
3) Remove this “Deployment options” block from the Security page (do not duplicate it there).
4) Restore/upgrade “How CloudVerse works” using the existing component:
   File exists: client/src/components/home/HowItWorks.tsx
   - Use the stronger card layout (Connect / Normalize / Automate)
   - Replace “empty gray tile boxes” with small “mini UI preview” content (simple mock UI elements, tags, tiny rows, badges). No blank placeholders.
   - Must be responsive (stacked on mobile, 3 columns on desktop).
5) Reduce excessive vertical gaps between sections on Home:
   - Standardize section spacing (use consistent py across sections)
   - Avoid double-padding (section wrapper + inner component)
6) Remove “Security” from the top nav:
   - Update client/src/components/SiteNav.tsx (and any mobile nav variant)
   - Header menu should be: Platform, Solutions, Integrations, Resources, Pricing (+ Sign in + Book a demo)
7) Clean up format issues and repetition:
   - Ensure Home doesn’t render duplicated CTAs or repeated headings.
   - Ensure no unused sections/components remain on Home.
8) Everything must look good on mobile/tablet/desktop.
   - Use max-width container alignment consistent with the page content.
   - Nav alignment should match the page container (no floating misalignment).
   - Menu text must be clearly visible (proper contrast, hover states).

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
A) Create a new component:
   - client/src/components/home/DeploymentOptions.tsx
   - Export default <DeploymentOptions />
   - Tailwind-only, Apple clean, subtle borders, consistent typography.
B) Update:
   - client/src/pages/Home.tsx: Insert <DeploymentOptions /> directly below hero, then the rest.
   - client/src/pages/Security.tsx: Remove the deployment options block entirely.
   - client/src/components/SiteNav.tsx: Remove Security from nav + improve contrast/active/hover styles.
   - client/src/components/home/HowItWorks.tsx: Replace placeholder tiles with mini UI previews.

DELIVERABLE
- Commit-like output: show the exact files changed and the final code diffs (or full updated file contents if easier).
- Do not change routing structure unless required for removing the nav item.
- Do not add new dependencies.
