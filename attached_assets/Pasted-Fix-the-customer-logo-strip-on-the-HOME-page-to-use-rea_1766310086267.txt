Fix the customer logo strip on the HOME page to use real image files (not text placeholders) and make it look correct on a dark background.

DO NOT change Home hero headline/H1.
ONLY modify the logo strip component + assets paths + styling needed for this.

------------------------------------------------------------
TASK 1 — MOVE/CONFIRM ASSETS IN PUBLIC
Ensure these files exist under the public folder so Vite/React can serve them:
- client/public/logos/axis-max-life-insurance-logo.svg
- client/public/logos/logo-1-1-sisl.png
- client/public/logos/logo-white-Shaw.png

Also add:
- a Dr. Reddy’s logo file (svg or png) under client/public/logos/
- an Infogain logo file (svg or png) under client/public/logos/
If a logo file is missing, create a TODO comment and keep the slot hidden (do not render text in place of the logo).

------------------------------------------------------------
TASK 2 — DEFINE A SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH ARRAY
Create a logos array used by the Home logo strip only, like:

const customerLogos = [
 { name: "Dr. Reddy’s", src: "/logos/dr-reddys.svg", href: null },
 { name: "Infogain", src: "/logos/infogain.svg", href: null },
 { name: "Max Life Insurance", src: "/logos/axis-max-life-insurance-logo.svg", href: null },
 { name: "Shaw Industries", src: "/logos/logo-white-Shaw.png", href: null },
 { name: "SISL Infotech", src: "/logos/logo-1-1-sisl.png", href: null },
];

Rules:
- src MUST be a real file path in /public
- Do not render entries whose image fails to load; hide them (no text fallback)

------------------------------------------------------------
TASK 3 — RENDER AS <img> (NOT TEXT)
Update the logo strip component to render:
<img src={logo.src} alt={logo.name} loading="lazy" decoding="async" />

No SVG inline conversion. No icon fonts. No text placeholders.

If href exists, wrap in <a> with target=_blank and rel=noopener. If href is null, do not link.

------------------------------------------------------------
TASK 4 — FIX CONTRAST + SIZING (DARK BACKGROUND)
The current strip is too faint. Make it premium and readable:

Container:
- centered, max 1600px width
- compact padding (py-8 or py-10)
- keep the context line:
  “Used by FinOps teams at leading enterprises.”

Row layout:
- horizontal row on desktop, wraps on smaller screens
- use gap-x-10 gap-y-6 (or similar)
- align items center

Logo sizing:
- enforce a consistent height across all logos:
  className="h-7 md:h-8 w-auto object-contain"
- for wide logos (Shaw), allow h-6 on mobile if needed

Visibility:
- DO NOT set opacity as low as 0.4–0.6; it becomes unreadable.
- Use one of these approaches:
  A) opacity-80 on the images + slightly brighter text
  OR
  B) keep logos at opacity-100 and reduce their visual dominance by smaller size

Pick AIX-style:
- logos: opacity-80 hover:opacity-100 transition
- no blur, no drop shadow, no borders

Important:
- Do not use invert unless needed.
- Since Shaw logo is already white, do NOT invert it.
- If any logo is dark-on-transparent and disappears on dark background,
  apply a per-logo class to brighten it:
  e.g. className includes "brightness-200" ONLY for that specific logo.

Implement per-logo overrides:
customerLogos entries can include optional className:
{ name, src, className?: string }
Example:
- Infogain may need "brightness-150"
- Dr Reddy’s may need "brightness-125"
Do not globally brighten all logos.

------------------------------------------------------------
TASK 5 — HANDLE SVGs CORRECTLY
SVG files must display without being dimmed by parent styles.
Make sure no parent container applies:
- opacity
- mix-blend-mode
- filter
that affects children unexpectedly.

If the row container uses opacity, remove it and apply opacity to each <img> instead.

------------------------------------------------------------
TASK 6 — QA CHECK
After changes:
- Logos must be clearly visible on the dark background.
- Heights should look visually consistent.
- No text placeholders should appear.
- If a logo asset is missing, its slot should not render (no broken icons).

DELIVERABLE
- Home logo strip uses real image assets from /public/logos/
- Correct sizing, alignment, and contrast on dark background
- AIX-style minimal look: calm, clean, premium
