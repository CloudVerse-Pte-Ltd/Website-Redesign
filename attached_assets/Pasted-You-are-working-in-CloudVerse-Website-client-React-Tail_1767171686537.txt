You are working in CloudVerse-Website/client (React + Tailwind marketing site). 

OBJECTIVES (DO ALL)
1) Rebuild Solutions page so it is strong, enterprise-grade, and clearly communicates “what’s in it for”:
   - Finance (FinOps / FP&A)
   - Engineering (Platform / SRE / Dev)
   - Business (BU owners / Product / leadership)
   - IT (Central IT / governance / security-adjacent controls)
   - AI/Data teams (ML, data platform, GPU/LLM workloads)
   Solutions page must not look empty or left-aligned with huge unused space.

2) Add a TOP NAV menu item “Partners” and build a full /partners page.
   Partners page is for MSP/GSI/Resellers who want to embed CloudVerse into their workflows, improve revenue, and/or resell.
   This page should be best-in-class and feel like modern enterprise partner programs.

3) Fix Home hero right-side “window” outcomes card:
   - Logos are not fit/visible in dark/light themes (low contrast + sizing)
   - Text is still tightly spaced
   - Card feels smaller than left hero content on desktop
   Improve spacing, typography, and logo treatment so it looks premium.

NON-NEGOTIABLE UX RULES
- All pages must be responsive: mobile, tablet, desktop.
- Use consistent max-width container alignment across pages and header.
- Reduce excessive whitespace between sections; use consistent section rhythm.
- Apple-clean spacing: comfortable line-height, consistent bullet counts, tidy blocks.
- No new dependencies.

========================
A) SOLUTIONS PAGE (REBUILD)
========================
File: client/src/pages/Solutions.tsx (or equivalent)

Replace the existing weak layout with a “role-based outcomes” design:

1) Hero
   - Title: “Solutions for every team that touches spend.”
   - Subtitle: “Finance, Engineering, IT, Business, and AI/Data teams use CloudVerse to see spend clearly, enforce accountability, and act on savings.”
   - Primary CTA: Book a demo
   - Secondary CTA: View integrations (links to /integrations)

2) Role selector (tabs or segmented control) with 5 roles:
   - Finance
   - Engineering
   - Business
   - IT & Platform
   - AI / Data

3) For each role, show:
   - A short “Top outcomes” list (3–5 bullets max)
   - “Typical dashboards / views” micro-copy (NOT skeleton boxes; use a mini preview card like “Finance view: variance + allocation + forecast”)
   - 3 “Use cases” cards (short title + 1 line)
   - A “How CloudVerse helps” strip (Connect → Normalize → Analyze → Act) but tailored to that role

4) Ensure the page fills width properly:
   - Use a 2-column layout on desktop: left text, right mini preview card
   - On mobile, stack with correct spacing.
   - No giant empty margins.

Role content (use exactly this positioning, keep concise):
- Finance (FinOps / FP&A)
  Outcomes:
   • Unified multi-cloud cost visibility by BU/app/product
   • Allocation-ready dimensions + audit-ready reports
   • Forecasting + budget variance visibility (even if forecasting is minimal, position as “trend + variance + targets”)
   • Realized savings tracking (not estimates)
  Use cases:
   • Monthly close support and chargeback/showback views
   • Unit economics by product/channel
   • Executive reporting packs
  Preview microcopy:
   “Typical Finance view: spend variance, allocations, and savings realization.”

- Engineering (Platform / SRE / Dev)
  Outcomes:
   • Cost context where engineers work (services/environments/owners)
   • Actionable optimization recommendations with guardrails
   • Fewer surprises: anomaly alerts and ownership clarity
  Use cases:
   • Idle & rightsizing across compute/data services
   • Tag hygiene + ownership enforcement
   • Break down cost by env/service and deploy changes safely
  Preview microcopy:
   “Engineering context: service-level cost, environment split, recommended actions.”

- Business (BU / Product / Leadership)
  Outcomes:
   • Business unit accountability with clear cost drivers
   • Unit economics tied to usage/volume metrics
   • ROI and trend visibility for strategic decisions
  Use cases:
   • Cost per customer / transaction / workload
   • Compare products/regions/teams on spend efficiency
   • Leadership rollups across orgs
  Preview microcopy:
   “Business view: unit economics, BU rollups, driver attribution.”

- IT & Platform
  Outcomes:
   • Standardized cost model across providers + accounts
   • Policy-driven governance + access controls (without talking “security page”)
   • Centralized integrations and operational readiness
  Use cases:
   • Multi-tenant governance and access boundaries
   • Organization-wide tag standards and normalization
   • Platform-level KPIs and compliance signals
  Preview microcopy:
   “IT view: normalized dimensions, governance, and enterprise-wide controls.”

- AI / Data (ML, data platform, GPU/LLM)
  Outcomes:
   • Optimize GPU and AI workload spend with placement & utilization insights
   • Track LLM/API usage and cost signals (OpenAI + data platforms)
   • Detect anomalies in AI/data pipelines early
  Use cases:
   • GPU idle detection + scheduling optimization
   • LLM routing / token cost insights (position at high level)
   • Data warehouse/workspace cost attribution (Databricks now, Snowflake coming)
  Preview microcopy:
   “AI/Data view: GPU utilization, LLM spend signals, pipeline cost drivers.”

Add an end CTA section:
- Title: “See CloudVerse on your data.”
- Buttons: Book a demo / Contact sales
(Ensure this CTA does not duplicate with footer CTA if present; only one CTA block on Solutions.)

========================
B) PARTNERS PAGE (NEW)
========================
1) Add /partners route and page:
   File: client/src/pages/Partners.tsx
   Add route in routing file (where other pages are registered).
2) Add “Partners” to top nav:
   File: client/src/components/SiteNav.tsx (and any mobile nav)
   Place “Partners” between Integrations and Resources (ideal).

Partners page structure (full enterprise page):
- Hero:
   Title: “Partner with CloudVerse™”
   Subtitle: “For MSPs, GSIs, and Resellers who want to deliver measurable savings faster—and grow services revenue.”
   CTAs:
     Primary: Become a partner
     Secondary: Book a partner demo

- Partner value pillars (3 cards):
   1) Embed CloudVerse into your delivery
      “Bring visibility, allocation, and optimization into your FinOps / cloud managed services.”
   2) Grow revenue
      “Create new advisory + managed savings offerings, usage-based programs, and implementation packages.”
   3) Win and retain customers
      “Differentiate with multi-cloud coverage + AI/Data spend optimization.”

- Partner types (tabs or 3 columns):
   MSP / GSI / Reseller
   Each shows:
     • Best for
     • Typical motion
     • What you deliver with CloudVerse

- Program components (grid):
   • Co-selling support
   • Partner enablement & training
   • Multi-tenant / managed portfolio support (positioning only)
   • White-label / embedded options (only if true; otherwise say “embed into workflows”)
   • Deal registration (if not real, call it “commercial coordination”)
   • Implementation toolkit

- “How partners make money” section:
   Use 3 clean cards:
   • Implementation services
   • Managed FinOps / Optimization retainer
   • Resell / referral margin (use safe generic language)

- Partner workflow (simple 4-step horizontal):
   1) Qualify
   2) Connect customer data
   3) Deliver baseline + roadmap
   4) Ongoing optimization + reporting

- Social proof / logos strip (optional)
- Final CTA:
   “Talk to our partner team.”
   Buttons: Apply / Contact

IMPORTANT:
- Do not use weak placeholder text.
- Keep it concise and premium.
- Ensure page looks great on mobile/tablet.

Also wire buttons:
- “Become a partner” → open mailto:partners@cloudverse.ai (or if site has contact page, route there)
- “Book a partner demo” → same behavior as Book a demo (existing demo flow)

========================
C) HERO RIGHT-SIDE CARD FIX (HOME)
========================
File(s): client/src/pages/Home.tsx and the hero card component if separated.

Fix:
1) Card sizing on desktop:
   - Make the right card visually balanced with left hero block.
   - Increase width/height at lg/xl (e.g., lg:w-[520px] xl:w-[600px]) or use grid that allows it to breathe.
   - Ensure it does not look like a small widget.

2) Text spacing:
   - Increase vertical spacing between outcome items: space-y-6 or space-y-7
   - Use better line-height: leading-6/7 for subtext
   - Constrain line lengths so it doesn’t feel cramped.

3) Logos visibility & theme correctness:
   - Ensure all provider logos render correctly in BOTH dark and light themes.
   - Use consistent sizing and alignment. No tiny/blurred icons.
   - For dark theme: logos should be white/neutral with enough contrast.
   - For light theme: logos should be dark/neutral with enough contrast.
   Implementation approach:
   - Maintain two logo assets per provider if required (dark-on-light and light-on-dark).
   - Or apply CSS filter strategy carefully (avoid ugly inversion).
   - Make sure AWS/Azure/GCP/OCI/Alicloud/Huawei/Tencent + OpenAI/Databricks + Kubernetes/OpenShift/vCenter are supported where needed.
   - Use a small 2-column grid for “Supported platforms” and “AI & GPU providers” inside the card.
   - Provide consistent padding and dividers.

4) Remove tight packing inside the card:
   - Increase card padding (p-8 on desktop)
   - Use subtle dividers and headings (“Supported platforms”, “AI & GPU providers”) with consistent small-caps styles.

========================
D) DELIVERABLES
========================
1) Update Solutions page as above.
2) Add /partners page + route + nav item.
3) Fix Home hero right-side card size, spacing, and logo visibility for dark/light.
4) Output the list of files changed and provide full updated content for:
   - Solutions.tsx
   - Partners.tsx
   - SiteNav.tsx
   - Home.tsx (or hero component file)
   - Any new small components added (ok)

Do not add new libraries. Keep Tailwind only. Ensure no duplicated CTA sections.
