Refactor the homepage “Instant Efficiency Snapshot” so results are shown in a modal instead of inline on the page.

Goal:
- Keep the homepage clean and minimal.
- After invoice upload + processing, show the output in a premium modal (executive tone).
- Do NOT mention AIX anywhere.

UI changes:
1) Homepage section (immediately after Hero):
   - Keep only: headline, one-paragraph explainer, drag/drop upload box, and “Get efficiency snapshot” button.
   - Remove the large right-side results card from the page layout entirely.
   - After parsing completes, show a small inline status row:
     - “Snapshot ready” + a “View snapshot” button (opens modal).
2) Add a modal component: <EfficiencySnapshotModal />
   - Opens automatically after parsing completes successfully.
   - Can also be opened manually via “View snapshot”.
   - Must be responsive:
     - Desktop: centered modal, max-width ~960px, scrollable body if needed
     - Mobile: full-screen sheet style (or modal with 95% height)
3) Modal content layout (in order):
   A) Header: “Efficiency snapshot” + close button
   B) Score block: big “XX/100” + small label + (optional) “Preliminary”
   C) “Invoice snapshot” key/values (render only available fields):
      - Provider
      - Billing period (start → end)
      - Total spend + currency
      - Line items parsed
      - Account/Subscription/Project identifier
   D) “Top spend” chips:
      - Top services by spend (max 3)
      - Top regions by spend (max 3)
   E) “Top line items detected” (max 5):
      - Columns: Resource/Meter, Service, Qty (optional), Cost
      - On mobile convert rows into stacked mini-cards
   F) “Insights” list (3–5 bullets) referencing extracted facts (e.g., “EC2 is 41% of spend”)
   G) Footer actions:
      - Primary: Book a demo
      - Secondary: Upload another (resets state and closes modal)

Data/logic requirements:
- Extend parsing output model to include:
  currency, totalSpend, billingPeriodStart, billingPeriodEnd, providerDetected,
  lineItemCount, topServices[], topRegions[], topLineItems[], topAccountIdentifier, insights[]
- If resource IDs aren’t available, fall back to SKU/Meter name + usage type.
- Hide fields that are missing (no “N/A” clutter).

Implementation constraints:
- Keep components reusable and typed.
- Ensure theme-aware rendering (dark/light): text + logos must remain visible.
- Reduce vertical spacing between homepage sections by ~30–40% (standardize section padding).
- Add minimal tests for the aggregation helpers (totals, grouping).

Acceptance criteria:
- Upload → parse → modal opens automatically with extracted invoice facts (total spend, period, at least 3 detected items).
- Homepage stays clean with no big results card inline.
- No cramped text; modal spacing is premium and readable.
