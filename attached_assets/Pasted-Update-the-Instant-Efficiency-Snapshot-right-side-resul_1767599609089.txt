Update the “Instant Efficiency Snapshot” right-side result card to show clear proof we parsed the uploaded invoice.

Goals:
- Keep it an executive “snapshot”, but add invoice-derived facts so users trust we read the file.
- Do NOT mention AIX anywhere.

UI changes (Hero snapshot card):
1) Add a new section directly under the score: “Invoice snapshot”
   - Show these fields if available, otherwise hide the row:
     - Provider
     - Billing period (start → end)
     - Total spend (with currency)
     - Line items parsed (count)
     - Account / Subscription / Project (top detected identifier)
2) Add a “Top spend” row with 2–3 compact chips:
   - Top services by spend (max 3)
   - Top regions by spend (max 3)
3) Add a small table titled “Top line items detected” (max 5 rows):
   Columns: Resource/Meter, Service, Qty (optional), Cost
   - If resource-level IDs are not available, fall back to SKU/Meter name + usage type.
4) Rewrite the existing “Waste signals / Commitment coverage / Optimization potential” lines so they reference extracted facts,
   e.g., “Compute spend concentration: EC2 41% of total”, “On-demand compute: 68%”.
5) Improve spacing inside the card:
   - Increase vertical padding
   - Increase line-height
   - Add subtle dividers between blocks
   - Ensure readability on laptop + mobile (no cramped text)

Data/logic changes:
- Extend the invoice parsing output model to return:
  - currency
  - totalSpend
  - billingPeriodStart / billingPeriodEnd
  - providerDetected
  - lineItemCount
  - topServices[] (name, spend, percent)
  - topRegions[] (name, spend, percent)
  - topLineItems[] (displayName, service, quantity?, unit?, cost)
  - topAccountIdentifier (string)
- If parser currently returns only a score, implement a lightweight extraction layer:
  - Map provider based on invoice fields or SKU patterns
  - Sum total spend from line items
  - Derive top services/regions from line items grouping
  - Select top 5 line items by cost for the table
- If a field cannot be derived, omit it in UI (do not show “N/A” rows).

Implementation constraints:
- No new pages. Only update the homepage upload + results section.
- Keep components reusable and typed.
- Add unit tests for the aggregation helpers (grouping + totals).
- Ensure theme-aware rendering (dark/light): text and icons must stay visible.

Acceptance:
- After upload, the card clearly shows total spend, billing period, and at least 3 extracted items (services/regions/line items).
- No layout overflow on mobile; table becomes stacked rows on small screens.
