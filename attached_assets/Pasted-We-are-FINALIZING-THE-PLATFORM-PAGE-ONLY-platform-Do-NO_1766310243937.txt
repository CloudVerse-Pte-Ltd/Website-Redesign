We are FINALIZING THE PLATFORM PAGE ONLY (/platform).
Do NOT modify Home (locked), Pricing, Integrations, Solutions, or global layout.
Only touch the Platform page file(s) and components used exclusively by Platform.

============================================================
BRANDING & TRADEMARK RULES (STRICT)
- Use “CloudVerse™” ONLY in branding contexts:
  - Platform hero eyebrow (first mention on the page)
  - document.title
- Elsewhere use “CloudVerse” (no ™).

Set:
document.title = "Platform — CloudVerse™"

============================================================
PLATFORM PAGE GOAL
- Same aesthetic quality as Home (AIX-style): minimal, confident, product-led
- Fewer sections, less copy, stronger hierarchy
- Clear differentiation:
  1) Automation-first FinOps (we apply recommendations automatically)
  2) 40+ ML models powering recommendations
  3) Developer FinOps (shift-left)
  4) Autonomous Tag Engine
  5) Detected + predicted anomalies
- Tight vertical spacing (no giant gaps)

============================================================
SECTION STRUCTURE (KEEP IT TO ~6 SECTIONS)
1) Hero (copy + product frame)
2) Capabilities grid (6 items, crisp)
3) FeatureTabs (5 tabs, interactive but lightweight)
4) Workflow strip (Connect → Normalize → Detect → Automate → Report)
5) Security strip (quiet)
6) Final CTA

No additional sections.

============================================================
TASK 1 — HERO (MINIMAL, LOCKED COPY)

Eyebrow:
CloudVerse™

H1:
Control cloud spend at every layer.

Subhead:
Visibility, allocation, anomalies, and automation—built for enterprise scale across cloud, data, and AI.

CTAs:
Primary: Book a demo
Secondary: Explore integrations

Hero layout:
- Use a wide container like Home (max-w-[1600px] mx-auto px-6 lg:px-12)
- Desktop: 2 columns, gap-16 max
- Left text column constrained: max-w-[620px]
- Right: product frame (neutral skeleton UI, no placeholder text, no captions)
- Keep hero height natural (do NOT use min-h-screen)

Spacing:
- Use py-cv-sec-lg (not bigger)
- Keep eyebrow tight (mb-3)
- H1 bottom margin ~mb-6
- Subhead bottom margin ~mb-8
- Buttons gap ~gap-3

============================================================
TASK 2 — CAPABILITIES GRID (6 ITEMS, CRISP)
Section title:
What you get with CloudVerse

Section subtitle (one line only):
A platform built to report, detect, and act—automatically.

Grid:
- Desktop: 3 columns
- Tablet: 2 columns
- Mobile: 1 column
- Gap max: gap-10 / gap-12
- Prefer typography-first cards: light border, no shadows, no heavy chrome

Cards (EXACT COPY):

1) Visibility & Reporting
Real-time views across providers, accounts, regions, services, and resources.

2) Allocation & Chargeback
Audit-ready showback and chargeback with shared pools and rules.

3) Anomalies (Detected + Predicted)
Catch spend spikes and forecast risk before month-end.

4) Automation-first Optimization
Apply safe actions automatically with guardrails and approvals.

5) Developer FinOps (Shift-left)
Cost context in engineering workflows—before changes ship.

6) Autonomous Tag Engine
Normalize tags, fix drift, and map ownership for accurate allocation.

Card formatting:
- Title: text-base font-semibold
- Body: text-sm text-muted, max-w ~42ch
- No icons unless subtle and consistent

Spacing:
- Section: py-cv-sec-lg
- Title mb-3, subtitle mb-10

============================================================
TASK 3 — FEATURE TABS (KEY DIFFERENTIATOR ISLAND)
Build/update a FeatureTabs component used ONLY on Platform page.
Keep it lightweight:
- local component state only
- no global store
- no heavy animation
- accessibility: buttons with aria-selected, role="tablist"

Tabs (ORDER, LOCKED):
1) Visibility
2) Developer FinOps
3) Tag Engine
4) Anomalies
5) Automation

Default tab: Visibility

Layout:
- Outer: border + subtle radius (like AIX)
- Inside: 2-column layout on desktop:
  Left: tab content
  Right: product frame (same neutral skeleton)
- On mobile: stack vertically

TAB CONTENT (LOCKED COPY)

TAB 1 — Visibility
Title:
See spend clearly—across clouds and orgs.

Body:
Understand cost drivers from organization down to resource.

Bullets:
- Multi-cloud and multi-account views
- Drill-down without rebuilding dashboards
- Export-ready views for reporting

TAB 2 — Developer FinOps
Title:
Shift cost awareness left.

Body:
Bring cost signals into engineering decisions—early.

Bullets:
- Cost context aligned to services and environments
- Recommendations engineers can act on
- Fewer surprises, less rework

TAB 3 — Tag Engine
Title:
Clean dimensions power clean allocation.

Body:
Normalize and enrich tags, then map ownership automatically.

Bullets:
- Tag normalization and drift detection
- Ownership mapping using rules + ML
- Allocation that holds up under scrutiny

TAB 4 — Anomalies
Title:
Detect spikes. Predict risk.

Body:
Respond to abnormal spend and forecast overruns.

Bullets:
- Detected anomalies near real time
- Predicted anomalies using ML models
- Clear paths to investigate and fix

TAB 5 — Automation
Title:
Move from insight to action—automatically.

Body:
CloudVerse applies recommendations safely, not just reports them.

Bullets:
- 40+ ML models powering recommendations
- Guardrails, approvals, and safe automation
- Track savings as realized—not estimated

Style:
- Bullet list tight: space-y-2
- Typography minimal
- No long paragraphs

Spacing:
- Section py-cv-sec-lg
- Tabs header margin bottom mb-6
- Content gap-10 max

============================================================
TASK 4 — WORKFLOW STRIP (COMPACT, SINGLE LINE)
Section title:
How it fits into your workflow

One-line flow:
Connect → Normalize → Analyze → Detect → Automate → Report

Rules:
- Single row on desktop, wraps on small screens
- Typography only, subtle dividers
- No icons
- py-cv-sec-md
- Light background or subtle border

============================================================
TASK 5 — SECURITY STRIP (REUSE HOME STYLE)
Use the same quiet pattern as Home:

Title:
Security and compliance, built in.

Badges:
ISO 27001 • SOC 2 Type II

Link:
Visit Security →

Secondary: Contact sales

Rules:
- No extra copy

============================================================
TASK 7 — WIDTH & SPACING CONSISTENCY
The Platform page must not feel boxed.
Follow Home’s pattern:
- Outer container max-w-[1600px] for hero + FeatureTabs
- Text columns constrained for readability
- Replace any py-24/py-32 with py-cv-sec-lg
- Replace gap-24 with gap-12
- Remove stacked mb-16/mb-20 -> use mb-10/mb-8

============================================================
GUARDRAILS
- Do not change nav, footer, routes, or other pages.
- Do not add platform vendor lists.
- Do not add heavy animations.
- Do not introduce new design systems.
- Keep copy exactly as specified.

============================================================
DELIVERABLE
- /platform matches the Home page’s premium minimal aesthetic
- Clear differentiation: automation-first, 40+ ML models, shift-left, tag engine, anomalies
- Tight vertical spacing and wide layout where appropriate
- FeatureTabs island works and is accessible
