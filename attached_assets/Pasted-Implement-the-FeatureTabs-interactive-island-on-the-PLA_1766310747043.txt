Implement the FeatureTabs “interactive island” on the PLATFORM page ONLY.
Do NOT change Home, Pricing, Integrations, nav/footer, or other Platform sections.
Only touch /platform and the FeatureTabs component used exclusively by Platform.

============================================================
GOAL
- AIX/Apple-style minimal “island” section
- 5 tabs with lightweight interactivity (local state only)
- Clean typography, tight spacing, accessible tabs
- Right side shows a neutral product frame (skeleton), no placeholder text

============================================================
BRANDING
- Do NOT add CloudVerse™ anywhere new inside FeatureTabs content.
- ™ usage stays only in page title and hero eyebrow.

============================================================
SECTION PLACEMENT
- FeatureTabs sits after the “What you get with CloudVerse” grid and before the workflow strip.
- Keep it as one self-contained section.

============================================================
LAYOUT & WIDTH
- Outer container should feel wide (not boxed), like Home:
  max-w-[1600px] mx-auto px-6 lg:px-12
- The “island” container:
  - subtle border (border-white/10 on dark or border-black/10 on light)
  - rounded-2xl
  - background: slightly distinct surface (e.g. bg-white/5 on dark OR bg-neutral-50 on light)
  - no shadows, no gradients
- Inside: 2-column layout on desktop:
  - Left: tab buttons + content
  - Right: product frame skeleton
- On mobile: stack.

Spacing:
- Section padding: py-cv-sec-lg
- Island padding: p-6 md:p-10
- Internal grid gap: gap-10 max (not 24)

============================================================
ACCESSIBLE TAB SYSTEM (REQUIRED)
- Use buttons (not links) for tabs.
- Include:
  - role="tablist"
  - each tab button role="tab"
  - aria-selected on active tab
  - aria-controls linking to panel id
  - tabIndex for keyboard navigation
- Use local React state only:
  const [active, setActive] = useState("visibility")

No global stores, no heavy animation libraries.

============================================================
TABS (LOCKED ORDER + COPY)
Tabs (order):
1) Visibility
2) Developer FinOps
3) Tag Engine
4) Anomalies
5) Automation

Default: Visibility

Each tab panel has:
- Title (text-xl font-semibold)
- Body (text-sm muted, max-w-[56ch])
- Bullets (3, tight spacing)

TAB 1 — Visibility
Title:
See spend clearly—across clouds and orgs.
Body:
Understand cost drivers from organization down to resource.
Bullets:
- Multi-cloud and multi-account views
- Drill-down without rebuilding dashboards
- Export-ready views for reporting

TAB 2 — Developer FinOps
Title:
Shift cost awareness left.
Body:
Bring cost signals into engineering decisions—early.
Bullets:
- Cost context aligned to services and environments
- Recommendations engineers can act on
- Fewer surprises, less rework

TAB 3 — Tag Engine
Title:
Clean dimensions power clean allocation.
Body:
Normalize and enrich tags, then map ownership automatically.
Bullets:
- Tag normalization and drift detection
- Ownership mapping using rules + ML
- Allocation that holds up under scrutiny

TAB 4 — Anomalies
Title:
Detect spikes. Predict risk.
Body:
Respond to abnormal spend and forecast overruns.
Bullets:
- Detected anomalies near real time
- Predicted anomalies using ML models
- Clear paths to investigate and fix

TAB 5 — Automation
Title:
Move from insight to action—automatically.
Body:
CloudVerse applies recommendations safely, not just reports them.
Bullets:
- 40+ ML models powering recommendations
- Guardrails, approvals, and safe automation
- Track savings as realized—not estimated

============================================================
TAB BUTTON STYLING (MINIMAL)
- Tab buttons in a row on desktop, wrap on smaller screens.
- Active tab: subtle filled background, strong text
- Inactive: muted text, hover background
- No icons
- No underline animation
- Keep type small: text-sm

============================================================
RIGHT SIDE — PRODUCT FRAME SKELETON (NO TEXT)
- Use a neutral skeleton panel:
  - rounded-2xl
  - border subtle
  - bg surface slightly different than island background
- Inside skeleton: 2–3 blocks indicating UI cards/charts
- IMPORTANT: no “placeholder” text labels

============================================================
FAILSAFE
- If there is already a FeatureTabs component, update it rather than creating duplicates.
- Ensure the Platform page imports and uses this FeatureTabs once.

DELIVERABLE
- FeatureTabs island exists on /platform
- Looks premium and minimal
- Tabs are accessible and keyboard-friendly
- Right-side skeleton looks like product UI
