We are COMPLETING and LOCKING the Integrations page.
Route: /integrations

Goal: Best-in-class Integrations experience (cleaner than Vantage.sh and Datadog):
- Not a logo catalog
- A product-led normalization story + fast discovery UI
- Search, filters, categories, integration detail drawer
- Minimal AIX/Apple aesthetic (calm, structured, premium)

DO NOT modify Home (locked) or Platform page styling.
Only edit Integrations page and components used exclusively by Integrations.

============================================================
BRANDING & TITLE
- document.title = "Integrations — CloudVerse™"
- Use “CloudVerse™” ONLY in the page title and (optional) tiny eyebrow on hero.
- Everywhere else use “CloudVerse”.

============================================================
PAGE INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE (LOCKED)
Sections (in this order):
1) Hero (category positioning + short subhead)
2) “Normalization Layer” strip (3 principles)
3) Integrations Explorer (search + filters + categorized grid)
4) Enterprise Connectors (3 cards: Read-only, Scoped, Auditable)
5) “Request an integration” CTA (minimal)
6) FAQ (short, 5 items)

No other sections.

============================================================
SECTION 1 — HERO (MINIMAL, NOT A VENDOR LIST)
Eyebrow (optional):
Integrations

H1:
Connect your cloud, data, and AI platforms.

Subhead (single sentence only):
CloudVerse normalizes billing, usage, tags, and ownership into one consistent model—so reporting and automation work everywhere.

Primary CTA:
Explore integrations

Secondary CTA:
Request an integration

Layout:
- Wide container: max-w-[1600px] mx-auto px-6 lg:px-12
- Centered or left-aligned is fine, but MUST feel expansive (no boxed max-w-xl).
- Tight vertical padding: py-cv-sec-lg (not more)

============================================================
SECTION 2 — NORMALIZATION LAYER STRIP (3 PRINCIPLES)
Title:
A normalization layer, not a connector list.

3 items (typography-first, no icons required):
1) Standardize
Unify accounts, services, tags, and cost dimensions across sources.
2) Govern
Scoped permissions, audit logs, and safe automation guardrails.
3) Automate
Recommendations and actions work consistently across platforms.

Style:
- Compact: py-cv-sec-md
- Subtle divider lines, no heavy cards

============================================================
SECTION 3 — INTEGRATIONS EXPLORER (THE MAIN PRODUCT)
This is the “best in class” part.

Build an interactive explorer with:
- Search input (client-side)
- Category filter pills
- “Status” filter (Available / Beta / Coming soon)
- Grid of integration cards
- Clicking a card opens a right-side Drawer (or Modal) with details

IMPORTANT: This must remain minimal and fast. No external API needed.
Use local JSON/TS object as source of truth.

------------------------------------------------------------
DATA MODEL (SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH)
Create integrationsData.ts with:
type Integration = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  category: "Cloud" | "Data" | "AI" | "Kubernetes" | "SaaS" | "Observability" | "FinOps" | "Identity" | "Ticketing";
  status: "Available" | "Beta" | "Coming soon";
  short: string;          // 1-line value statement
  whatWeIngest: string[]; // 3–6 bullets
  outputs: string[];      // what features unlock (reporting, anomalies, automation)
  setup: {
    method: "Read-only API" | "Billing export" | "Agent" | "Webhook";
    timeToValue: string;  // e.g. "15–30 minutes"
    permissions: string;  // e.g. "Read-only, scoped to billing + usage"
  };
};

Seed the page with ~18–24 integrations across categories (mix statuses).
Do NOT try to list every vendor on day-1. This is about structure and trust.

------------------------------------------------------------
INTEGRATION CARD DESIGN (MINIMAL)

- Name
- Category
- Status badge (small)
- short (1 line)
No logos required (logos optional later). This avoids “logo zoo”.

Style:
- subtle border, rounded-xl/2xl
- no shadows
- hover: border becomes slightly stronger
- consistent spacing

------------------------------------------------------------
FILTERS (TOP OF EXPLORER)
- Search box (placeholder: “Search integrations…”)
- Category pills: All, Cloud, Data, AI, Kubernetes, SaaS, Observability, FinOps, Identity, Ticketing
- Status dropdown: All, Available, Beta, Coming soon

Make it feel like an Apple settings picker: clean, compact.

------------------------------------------------------------
DETAIL DRAWER (RIGHT SIDE)
On card click, open Drawer with:

Header:
- Integration name
- Status badge
- 1-line short description

Sections:
1) What CloudVerse ingests
   bullet list (3–6)
2) What it unlocks
   bullet list (3–6) e.g.
   - Reporting + drilldowns
   - Allocation dimensions
   - Detected + predicted anomalies
   - Automation paths
3) Setup
   - Method
   - Time to value
   - Permissions

Footer actions:
- Primary: Request access / Talk to us
- Secondary: View setup docs (if docs route exists; else hide)

No long paragraphs.

============================================================
SECTION 4 — ENTERPRISE CONNECTORS (3 TRUST CARDS)
Title:
Built for enterprise access patterns.

Cards (copy locked):
1) Read-only by default
Connections use scoped, least-privilege access.
2) Auditable and controlled
Every sync and action is logged for review.
3) Multiple ingestion modes
API, exports, and agents—depending on the platform.

Style:
- 3 columns desktop, 1 column mobile
- subtle borders, no shadows
- py-cv-sec-md

============================================================
SECTION 5 — REQUEST INTEGRATION CTA (MINIMAL)
Title:
Need a connector that isn’t listed?
Body:
Tell us what you use—we’ll prioritize it with you.
Button:
Request an integration

Optional: add a tiny inline form (email + system name) ONLY if it already exists. If not, keep button.

============================================================
SECTION 6 — FAQ (5 SHORT ITEMS)
Add a simple accordion or stacked Q/A (no heavy animations).

Questions + answers (locked):
1) How long does setup take?
Most connections are 15–30 minutes depending on method.
2) What permissions do you require?
Read-only, scoped to billing and usage wherever possible.
3) Do you support multi-account and multi-org setups?
Yes—CloudVerse supports enterprise hierarchies and tenancy boundaries.
4) Can we use exports instead of APIs?
Yes—billing exports are supported when APIs aren’t available.
5) Do integrations affect production performance?
No—connections are designed to be low overhead and read-only.

============================================================
SPACING & QUALITY GUARDRAILS
- Remove excessive vertical gaps:
  - Replace py-24/py-32 with py-cv-sec-lg
  - Replace gap-24 with gap-12
- Wide page feel: max-w-[1600px] for hero + explorer
- Keep paragraphs short (1–2 lines max)
- No vendor list in hero
- No logo wall
- No gradients or neon effects
- Keep dark theme consistent with current site

============================================================
DELIVERABLE
- /integrations looks premium and product-led
- Explorer is fast, searchable, filterable
- Detail drawer is structured and enterprise-trustworthy
- Page feels better than Vantage/Datadog because it emphasizes normalization + governance, not logos
- Treat this Integrations page as locked after completion
