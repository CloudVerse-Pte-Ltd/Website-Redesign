We already implemented the premium AIX-style motion hero on Home (motion gradient + faint grid + right-side glass “outcomes window” card). Now apply the SAME visual system across Platform, Solutions, and Security so the whole site feels cohesive and premium at all screen sizes.

DO NOT redesign the entire site. Keep the current brand (dark, minimal, Apple-like). Focus on:
- consistent hero pattern
- consistent spacing + typography
- strong responsive behavior (mobile/tablet/desktop)

============================================================
GLOBAL (DO ONCE)
1) Create shared components:
- <MotionHero /> wrapper that includes:
  - motion gradient layer
  - grid overlay layer
  - masked vignette overlay
  - responsive container (max-w-[1400px] + px-5 sm:px-6 lg:px-10 xl:px-12)
  - pt-24 pb-16 (mobile), lg:pt-32 lg:pb-24 (desktop)

- <OutcomesWindow /> component:
  - rounded-[28px], border-white/10, bg-white/[0.04]
  - window dots
  - uppercase eyebrow label
  - list of Outcome items (blue title, gray body)
  - subtle inner glow

2) Typography tokens (use everywhere):
- Eyebrow: text-xs tracking-[0.28em] uppercase text-white/55
- H1: text-4xl sm:text-5xl lg:text-6xl font-semibold tracking-tight leading-[1.03]
- Subhead: text-base sm:text-lg text-white/70 leading-7 max-w-[40rem]
- Section spacing: py-14 sm:py-16 lg:py-20 (avoid huge gaps)

3) Responsiveness:
- Hero layout stacks on mobile/tablet
- 2-column only at lg:grid-cols-2
- Copy block max-w ~44rem
- Outcomes window max-w ~640px and centered on smaller screens

============================================================
PLATFORM PAGE (/platform)
1) Replace current top hero area with MotionHero.
Left copy:
- Eyebrow: CLOUDVERSE™ PLATFORM
- H1: A unified platform for visibility, allocation, and automation.
- Subhead: Manage cloud, data, and AI spend with clean dimensions, anomalies, and automated actions.
CTAs: Book a demo + View integrations

Right OutcomesWindow label: CLOUDVERSE™ PILLARS
Outcomes list (5 items):
- Visibility across clouds and orgs
- Developer FinOps (Shift-left)
- Autonomous Tag Engine
- Detected + predicted anomalies
- Automation with guardrails + realized savings

2) Keep existing feature tabs section below, BUT tighten spacing:
- reduce excessive top padding
- ensure tabs wrap cleanly on tablet/mobile
- keep the section aligned to the same container width

============================================================
SOLUTIONS PAGE (/solutions)
Current layout feels left-empty. Rebuild to a clean, centered, minimal structure.

1) Add MotionHero at top.
Left copy:
- Eyebrow: CLOUDVERSE™ SOLUTIONS
- H1: Built for Finance, Engineering, and IT.

CTAs: Book a demo + Explore platform

Right OutcomesWindow label: WHAT TEAMS GET
Outcomes list (4 items):
- Audit-ready allocation
- Detected + predicted anomalies
- Automated optimization with guardrails
- Realized savings tracking

2) Below hero: a 3-card grid (equal height) for:
- Finance
- Engineering
- IT & Platform
Each card:
- title + 1-line description
- exactly 4 bullets (keep consistent)
Grid breakpoints:
- mobile 1 col
- md 2 col
- lg 3 col

3) End with a compact CTA strip (not tall):
- “See CloudVerse™ on your data.”
- Book a demo button

============================================================
SECURITY PAGE (/security)
1) Add MotionHero at top.
Left copy:
- Eyebrow: CLOUDVERSE™ SECURITY
- H1: Security and compliance, built in.
- Subhead: Designed for enterprise environments—from access control to auditability.
Add line: Private deployment and air-gapped options available for regulated environments.
CTA: Talk to security + Book a demo

Right OutcomesWindow label: CONTROLS
Outcomes list (5 items):
- SSO + SCIM (Google/Microsoft)
- RBAC + audit logs
- Data isolation by org
- Private deployment options
- Air-gapped deployment support

2) Below hero: “Deployment options” section with 3 cards:
- SaaS (multi-tenant)
- Private (VPC/VNet)
- Air-gapped
Each card includes: “Best for”, “What you get”, and 3 bullets.

============================================================
QA REQUIREMENTS
Verify at 375px / 768px / 1024px / 1440px:
- no cramped hero
- nav doesn’t wrap/overlap
- outcomes window scales cleanly
- cards don’t look stretched
- consistent spacing across pages

DELIVERABLE:
Platform, Solutions, Security all feel like the same premium system as Home.
