You are working in the CloudVerse Website repo (Next.js). Implement a new homepage section immediately AFTER the Hero (and BEFORE any “trusted by / logos” and BEFORE “How CloudVerse works”).

GOAL
Add an executive, conversion-focused “Invoice Efficiency Score” section:
- Headline: “Know how efficient your cloud is?”
- Subhead: “Upload a cloud invoice (PDF/CSV/XLSX) and get an instant efficiency score with a few high-signal insights.”
- Must feel premium, Apple-clean, consistent with the existing CloudVerse dark theme and responsive for mobile/tablet.

NON-NEGOTIABLES
- Do NOT mention any other product name in UI, code comments, copy, routes, or variables.
- Do NOT add credential prompts. This is upload-only.
- Must work in both dark and light themes.
- No broken layout at any viewport width (mobile/tablet/desktop).
- No repeated sections or duplicate headings.
- Keep vertical spacing tight: remove excessive gaps between sections (use consistent section padding).

SECTION STRUCTURE (2-column, responsive)
1) Left column (copy + trust):
   - Eyebrow (small): “INSTANT EFFICIENCY SNAPSHOT”
   - H2: “Know how efficient your cloud is?”
   - Body: “Upload a cloud invoice and receive a read-only efficiency snapshot—highlighting waste signals, coverage gaps, and optimization potential.”
   - 3 bullets (short, executive):
     - “Preliminary efficiency score (0–100)”
     - “Top waste signals and coverage gaps”
     - “Optimization potential range”
   - Trust line (small): “Read-only analysis. No credentials. Files encrypted in transit and deleted after processing.”

2) Right column (interactive card):
   Create a premium “macOS-window” style card (rounded 24px, subtle border, soft shadow) with:
   - Top bar with 3 dots (red/yellow/green) + right aligned label “EFFICIENCY SCORE”
   - Main content switches based on state:
     A) Idle state: upload dropzone (dashed border, icon, “Drop invoice here or click to upload”, supported formats line)
     B) Processing state: subtle progress bar shimmer + “Analyzing invoice…”
     C) Result state: big score badge + 4 insight rows + CTA buttons

RESULT STATE DETAILS
When upload completes (mocked), render:
- Score: large number (e.g., 78) with label “Preliminary efficiency score”
- Insight rows (4):
  1) “Spend coverage” → “Compute • Storage • Network” (and “AI signals: Not detected” if none)
  2) “Waste signals” → “Idle/overprovision indicators detected”
  3) “Commitment coverage” → “On-demand heavy: Medium”
  4) “Optimization potential” → “Estimated: 12–28%”
- Buttons:
  - Primary: “Book a demo” (routes to existing /book or existing CTA handler used elsewhere)
  - Secondary: “Upload another” (resets state)

BEHAVIOR
- Use a real <input type="file"> with drag-and-drop support.
- Accept: .pdf,.csv,.xlsx
- Max file size: 20MB (frontend validate)
- Immediately on select/drop:
  - set state to “processing” for ~1.2s (simulate analysis)
  - then set state to “result” with mocked output
- Add error state:
  - Unsupported type or >20MB → show inline error message inside card; do not break layout.

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
- Create a new component: components/home/InvoiceEfficiencySection.tsx (or equivalent pattern used in repo).
- Add it to the Home page directly under Hero.
- Keep all copy in this component (no i18n needed unless repo already uses it).
- Use existing design tokens, typography scale, and spacing conventions from the repo.
- Ensure it is accessible (keyboard focus, aria labels for file input, contrast-safe text).

RESPONSIVE RULES
- Desktop: two columns (left text ~55%, right card ~45%), balanced heights, no cramped spacing.
- Tablet: two columns but smaller; card must not shrink text too tightly (increase padding, allow wrapping).
- Mobile: stack vertically; card goes first or second (choose the more premium flow: keep copy first, card second). Ensure padding and font sizes scale smoothly.

TIGHTEN SPACING BETWEEN SECTIONS
Audit homepage section wrappers and reduce excessive vertical gaps:
- Standardize section padding to something like py-16 (desktop) / py-12 (tablet) / py-10 (mobile) unless a section intentionally needs more.
- Remove any stray empty dividers, duplicate “trusted by” rows, or repeated hero blocks.

DO NOT BREAK EXISTING NAV/CTA
- Keep header/nav behavior intact.
- Ensure “Book a demo” CTA continues to work as it already does elsewhere (reuse existing link component / route).

DELIVERABLE
- Implement the new section, wired and working with mocked analysis.
- Ensure the homepage renders cleanly and consistently across breakpoints.
- Provide a brief note in code comments ONLY where needed (avoid noise).
